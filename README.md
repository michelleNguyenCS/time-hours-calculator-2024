Problem: I keep track of the times I spend working on things, and I often take so many breaks that I would have to calculate a bunch of times separately and add them together.\
This program is meant to solve that problem for me and calculate the total time I spent working on something.

Supported Commands:
- MANUAL : allows you to enter two times in and calculate the time elapsed between those two
- FILE : allows you to enter a file name filled with times and calculate the total time elapsed

Note:
- Program assumes the inputted times will be valid. I didn't do time-checking, so a user could type in 15:96AM or other invalid numbers. 
- I did not do a lot of test-casing, so mistakes in calculations are possible.
- times.txt is not required for the program, it's just an example of how the times need to be formatted for the FILE command. Fun fact, those are the actual times I spent working on a building project in HS.
